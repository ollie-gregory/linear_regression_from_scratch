# linear_regression_from_scratch

This repository contains my implementation of the linear regression algorithm from scratch in both Python and C++ as part of a series of from scratch machine learning algorithm implementations. The purpose is to develop my understanding of these algorithms and improve my programming skills in C++.

## Replicating the Project

### Python

1. Navigate to the `python` directory and create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    cd python
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### C++ 

Full implementation is yet to be created.
